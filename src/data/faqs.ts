    question: "What happens during the Discovery Call?",
    answer: "It's simple and pressure-free. We'll ask a few key questions, review your health history, and see if our program is the right fit. If we can help, we'll walk you through options. If not, we'll point you to a better fit."
  },
  {
    question: "Are your programs safe?",
    answer: "Yes. Our protocols are grounded in current functional and integrative medicine research. Instead of masking symptoms, we use objective testing to find root causes and restore balance naturally."
  },
  {
    question: "Does insurance cover integrative medicine?",
    answer: "Most plans don't cover integrative/functional care. That said, our programs are designed to be accessible, and we work with motivated clients to find a path forward."
  },
  {
    question: "Where is your clinic located?",
    answer: "We're 100% virtual. After your discovery call, if we're a good fit, we'll ship at-home test kits and build a personalized, safe, and effective plan based on your results."
  },
  {
    question: "Will I need to take a lot of supplements?",
    answer: "Not necessarily. We recommend targeted supplements based on your labs (e.g., nutrient status, genetics) and coach you on nutrient-dense foods so you're not relying on pills."

    question: "Why can't I lose weight even when I'm eating healthy and exercising?",
