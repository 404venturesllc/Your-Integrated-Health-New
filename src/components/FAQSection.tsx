      question: 'How do I get started with your program?',
      answer: 'Simply book a free consultation call. We\'ll discuss your health history, symptoms, and goals to determine if our program is right for you. From there, we\'ll order labs and create your personalized plan.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is GLP-1 medication right for me?',
      answer: 'GLP-1 medications can be highly effective for weight loss and metabolic health when combined with lifestyle changes. During your consultation, we\'ll review your medical history, current health status, and goals to determine if it\'s appropriate for you.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you accept insurance?',
      answer: 'We\'re a cash-pay practice to provide personalized care without insurance limitations. However, we provide detailed receipts (superbills) that you can submit to your insurance for potential reimbursement. Many HSA/FSA accounts also cover our services.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does the program take?',
      answer: 'While initial results can be seen within the first few weeks, we recommend a minimum 3-6 month commitment for lasting transformation. Our quarterly follow-ups ensure your plan adapts as your body changes and helps maintain long-term results.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What makes your approach different?',
      answer: 'We combine GLP-1 medication with comprehensive lifestyle, nutrition, gut health, and hormone balancing support. Rather than just prescribing medication, we address root causes and create sustainable habits for lasting wellness.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need to live in a specific state?',
      answer: 'We offer telehealth services to patients in multiple states. During your consultation, we\'ll confirm that we\'re licensed to practice in your state and can provide care for you.',
