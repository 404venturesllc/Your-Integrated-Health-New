   their individual lab results and specific needs. No one-size-fits-all
   approaches.

   wellness. It's not just about one symptom or one system.

   We help patients understand their health and take an active role in their
   health decisions. Knowledge is power.

   Comprehensive hormone balancing and metabolic optimization are at the core
   of our approach.

INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE FOCUS:

================================================================================
SECTION 7: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q1: WHAT HAPPENS DURING THE DISCOVERY CALL?

The discovery call is simple and pressure-free. We'll ask key questions, review
your health history, and see if our program is the right fit for you. If it is,
we'll walk you through your options. If not, we'll point you toward a better
fit. There's no obligation or pressure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q2: ARE YOUR PROGRAMS SAFE?

Yes. Our protocols are grounded in current functional and integrative medicine
research. Instead of just masking symptoms, we use objective testing to find
the root causes and restore balance naturally. Safety is our top priority.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q3: DOES INSURANCE COVER INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE?

Most insurance plans don't cover integrative or functional care. However, we've
designed our programs to be accessible, and we work with motivated clients to
find a path forward. We don't accept insurance directly, but we can provide
receipts for potential reimbursement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q4: WHERE IS YOUR CLINIC LOCATED?

We operate on a 100% virtual service model. After your discovery call (if we're
a good fit), we ship at-home test kits to your door. We then build you a
personalized, safe, and effective plan based on your results. You can work with
us from anywhere.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q5: WILL I NEED TO TAKE A LOT OF SUPPLEMENTS?

Not necessarily. We only recommend targeted supplements based on your specific
lab results, including your nutrient status and genetics. We also coach you on
nutrient-dense foods so you're not just relying on pills. Supplements are used
strategically, not excessively.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q6: DO YOU PROVIDE SUPPORT AND ACCOUNTABILITY?

Absolutely. We'll provide you with a clear plan, ongoing guidance, and 24/7
email access with a 24-hour response time. We're here to help you stay on track
and achieve your health goals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q7: WHY CAN'T I LOSE WEIGHT EVEN WHEN I'M EATING HEALTHY AND EXERCISING?

Weight loss resistance is often about more than diet and workouts. Hormone
imbalances, nutrient deficiencies, chronic stress, poor sleep, and gut issues
can all stall your progress. We address these root causes so your body can
finally respond to your healthy efforts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q8: WILL I HAVE TO TAKE MEDICATION FOREVER?

No. Our goal is not to keep you on medication indefinitely. We aim to heal your
metabolism from within and help you transition off GLP-1 therapy without
rebound weight gain. The medication is a tool to help you achieve lasting
results, not a permanent solution.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q9: HOW IS YOUR PROGRAM DIFFERENT FROM OTHER WEIGHT LOSS CLINICS?

We go beyond just prescriptions. Our program includes hormone balancing, gentle
detoxification, nutrient repletion, gut repair, and stress management. We
address the whole body so your results actually last. It's not a quick fix;
it's sustainable transformation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q10: DO YOU OFFER VIRTUAL APPOINTMENTS?

Yes! Our entire service model is virtual/telehealth, making it easy to work
with us from anywhere. No office visits required.
